# Photo pull list

Hero images for the hotel pages. One per hotel: `src/assets/hotels/<slug>.jpg`.
The filename IS the wiring — drop a correctly-named file in that directory and
the hero appears. Then set `heroCredit` on the hotel in `src/data/hotels.js` to
the property name, and the page renders *"Photo courtesy of <property>."*

> **Source rule** (inherited from Jet & Swim's `FORA_PULL_LIST.md`): Fora Portal
> assets, our own photography, or free stock only — **never** a hotel's own
> website, and never Booking.com. Booking's API terms permit hot-linking their

Credit the property under any Portal photo. Free stock (Unsplash/Pexels) needs no
property credit but should not be presented as the hotel if it isn't.

## Needed

### Nashville, TN  (1)
- [ ] `the-nash-nashville` — The Nash (Fora has nothing; Karen deciding between
      a permissioned crop of the opalcollection.com rooftop-gallery shot or
      requesting an asset from her Nash partner contact)

**1 to pull, 9 to re-verify.** Thirteen cities are fully photographed: Dallas,
Washington DC, Houston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin, Chicago,
New Orleans, Phoenix, Denver, New York and Miami. Remaining: The Nash only.

(The "Editor's Pick, homepage" markers previously on some entries were stale —
the homepage picks grid hard-codes six hotels, all photographed; a hotel's
city-level pick status lives in `pick: true` in src/data/hotels.js.)

Note on Fora availability: LA's Portal selection was thin — if better images
surface later, replacing one is a drop-in (the filename is the wiring, so
overwriting `<slug>.jpg` is the whole job).
